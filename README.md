#EMMV

an attempt to recreate the Nybble robot by 李荣仲 (https://www.petoi.com/)

the parts are 3D printed with a [...] according to these templates [...]

the code is taken from [...] and amended to work with an ESP32 instead of the original petoi hardware

EMMV is named after my own cat, Emmi, who has proofread the code several times to ensure everything is working correctly
