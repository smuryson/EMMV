## serialMaster User Guide

**Preparation**

1.  Install python (versionâ‰¥ 3.6, such as Anaconda3-5.2.0-Windows-x86_64.exe)
    
2.  Install pyserial library (version 3.5)
    
**Run script**

The script program will automatically identify the serial port number at the very beginning of the run, and complete the connection.

Generally, when using a USB adapter to connect to Nybble (or Bittle), there is only one serial port number:

When using the Bluetooth module, there are two serial port numbers:

Open Terminal (such as Anaconda Prompt), enter the path where the script is located (***\serialMaster), you can use the following command to run the script:

**Method 1**: Run the **ardSerial.py**

***\serialMaster>python3 ardSerial.py kbalance

Parameters: **kbalance** is a serial port command representing Nybble (or Bittle) skills.

Of course, you can also run this script without any parameters:

***\serialMaster>python3 ardSerial.py

When the system recognizes that there are multiple serial port numbers, the script will print out the following prompt message at the very beginning of the run:

**If there is no response after you input the serial command in the terminal, you should close the terminal first, then change the value of "bluetoothPortIndex" in the ardSerial.py (line:128)to connect to another blue tooth serial port, then reopen the terminal and rerun the script.**

When the script formally starts running, the following prompt information is printed out:
**You can type 'quit' or 'q' to exit.**

Next, you can enter serial port commands in Terminal to control Nybble (or Bittle) to do various interesting actions e.g.

kbalance           # Command to control Nybble(or Bittle) to stand normally

m 0 -30 0 30       # Command to control Nybble(or Bittle) head to swing left and right

**Method 2**: Run a custom script, e.g.  **example.py**

***\serialMaster>python3 example.py

The list **testSchedule** in example.py is used to test various serial port commands. Run the following script code to see the execution effect of each serial port command in the list:

for task in testSchedule:
	wrapper(task)

You can also refer to the content of the **stepUpSchedule** list (in***\serialMaster\demos\stepup.py), write a list of behaviors according to your actual needs, and realize your creativity.

**Note**: When running the scripts under the path **"***\serialMaster\demos"**, you must first use the **"cd demos"** command to enter the path where the scripts are located (\serialMaster\demos), and then use the **python3** command to run the script. e.g. 
***\serialMaster\demos>python3 stepup.py

Explanation of the serial port commands in the list**testSchedule**:

**['kbalance', 2]**
-   'kbalance' indicates the command to control Bittle to stand normally
-   2 indicates the postponed time after finishing the command, in seconds

**['m', [0, -20], 1.5]**
- m indicates the command to control the rotation of the joint servo
-   0 indicates the index number of joint servo
-   -20 indicates the rotation angle (this angle refers to the origin, rather than additive) the unit is degree
-   1.5 indicates the postponed time after finishing the command, in seconds. It can be a float number

**['m', ['m', '0', '45', '0', '-45', '0', '45', '0', '-45'], 2]**

Using this format, multiple joint servo rotation commands can be issued at one time, and these joint servo rotation commands are executed **SEQUENTIALLY**, not at the same time.
The meaning of this example is: the joint servo with index number 0 is first rotated to the 45 degree position, and then rotated to the -45 degree position, and so on. After these motion commands are completed, the next command will be executed after a 2-second delay.

**['M', ['M', '8', '-15', '9', '-20'], 2]**

Using this format, multiple joint servo rotation commands can be issued at one time, and these joint servo rotation commands are executed **AT THE SAME TIME.**
The meaning of this example is the joint servos with index numbers 8, 9 are rotated to the -15, -20 degree positions at the same time. After these motion commands are completed, the next command will be executed after a 2-second delay.

**['d', 2]**
-   d indicates the command to put the robot down and shut down the servos
-   2 indicates the postponed time after finishing the command, in seconds

**['c', 2]**
-   c indicates the command to enter calibration mode
-   2 indicates the postponed time after finishing the command, in seconds. After these motion commands are completed, the next command will be executed after a 2-second delay.

**['c', [0, -9], 2]**
-   c indicates the command to enter calibration mode
-   0 indicates the index number of joint servo
-   -9 indicates the rotation angle, the unit is degree
-   2 indicates the postponed time after finishing the command, in seconds

Using this format, you can enter the calibration mode to calibrate the angle of a certain joint servo.
**Note**: If you want the correction value in this command to take effect, you need to enter the "**s"**command after executing this command.
The meaning of this example: the joint servo with serial number 0 rotates -9 degrees. After these motion commands are completed, the next command will be executed after a 2-second delay.

**['i', [8, 50, 9, 50, 10, 50, 11, 50, 0, 0], 3]**
-   i indicates the command to rotate multiple joint servos at the same time
-   8, 9, 10, 11, 0 indicate the index numbers of joint servos
-   50, 50, 50, 50, 0 indicate the rotation angle (this angle refers to the origin, rather than additive ), the unit is degree
-   3 indicates the postponed time after finishing the command, in seconds
 
**['l', [20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 45, 45, 45, 45, 36, 36, 36, 36], 5]**
-   l indicates the command to control all joint servos to rotate at the same time (currently the command supports 16 degrees of freedom, that is, 16 servos)
-   20,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,45,45,45,45,36,36,36,36 indicate the rotation angle of each joint servo corresponding to 0-15 (this angle refers to the origin, rather than additive), the unit is degree
-   5 indicates the postponed time after finishing the command, in seconds

**['b', [10, 255], 2]**
-   b indicates the command to control the buzzer to beep
-   10 indicates the music tone
-   255 indicates the lengths of duration, the value range is 0~255 
-   2 indicates the postponed time after completing the pronunciation, in seconds

**['b', ['b', '14', '90', '14', '90', '21', '90', '21', '90', â€˜23', '90', '23', '90', '21', '180'], 5]**
-   b indicates the command to control the buzzer to beep
-   '14', '14', '21', '21', â€˜23', '23', '21' indicate the music tones
-   '90', '90', '90', '90', '90', '90', '180' indicates the lengths of duration
-   5 indicates the postponed time after the music melody is played, in seconds

Using this format, multiple tone pronunciation commands can be issued at one time, and a simple melody can be played.
The meaning of this example is: play a simple melody, and delay 5 seconds after the music melody is played.

For the description of other serial port commands, please refer to Chapter 7 of the Petoi Bittle User Manuals:

Please help Nybble and Bittle find their sparks. Wish you have fun!
